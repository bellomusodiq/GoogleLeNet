# GoogLeNet

## This is a pytorch based implementation of GoogLeNet

GoogLeNet is the winner of ILSVRC 2014 (Image Classification)

GoogLeNet is a type of convolutional neural network based on the Inception architecture. It utilises Inception modules, which allow the network to choose between multiple convolutional filter sizes in each block. An Inception network stacks these modules on top of each other, with occasional max-pooling layers with stride 2 to halve the resolution of the grid.
